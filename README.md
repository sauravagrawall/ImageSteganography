ImageSteganography

Almost all digital file formats can be used as a cover file to contain a hidden data or secret messages. However, the ability of such files to embed secret data depends on the availability of redundant or insignificant areas within these files. The redundant bits of a cover file are those bits that can be altered without the alteration being detected easily. Redundancy is defined as the bits of a cover object that provide accuracy far greater than necessary for the objectâ€™s use and display. 
For example, image files can display 16 million different colours, while the human eye is only able to perceive about 10 million different colours (Owens, 2002). The file formats with a high degree of redundancy is preferable, since redundant bits can be substituted with secret information in an imperceptible and undetectable manner. Thus, in the case of interception by an unauthorised recipient, the appearance of cover files should not indicate the existence of hidden data. Many kinds of digital media such as text, image, audio, and video files can be used as cover files.

Note: For the above implementation to work properly, the user must import the PIL package among other packages using py.
